# Java File Sync
A simple file server which helps sync files between two directories. These directories must reside on different machines but on the same network. It also allows to resume interrupted syncing. That means, if a file is not available in one of the directories and is being transferred, but the transfer gets interrupted, next time the program will finish the transfer.
