# Java File Sync
A simple file server which helps sync files between two directories on two different hosts. These hosts must be connected to the same network. It also allows to resume interrupted syncing. So, a file not available in one of the directories, will be transferred to it from the other directory on the other host. However, if the transfer gets interrupted, next time the program will finish the transfer.
